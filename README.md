Publication metrics of the SIMR between 2010 and 2019.

Summary of our findings on SIMR papers:

  * Total publications between 2000 and 2019 were greater than 1000, but a free API key only allowed tracking of ~ 200 papers.
  * Papers published by Stowers scientists are distributed to high-reputation, high-impact publishers. Some examples include Development, Cell, Nature, eLife, PLoS Genetics, Nature Communications, Nature Genetics, etc.
  * There were two non-English papers - they were written in French. 
  * Number of authors in a publication were usually greater and equal to 2 people. This suggests SIMR scientists are a collaborative bunch!
  * The department with the top contribution of papers is: Proteomics, Trainor Lab, and Workman Lab, at almost equal numbers. Impressive!
